# MedAid

Med Aid is a one-stop digital healthcare platform designed to make medical access simple, affordable, and intelligent for every Indian. It allows users—especially from rural and underserved areas—to input their symptoms through voice or text (in English, Hindi, or Telugu) and receive AI-driven symptom analysis with possible causes and remedies. Users can instantly locate nearby hospitals via Google Maps integration, check the availability of medicines in government Jan Aushadhi stores and PHCs, and even verify their eligibility for health subsidies. For more accurate care, Med Aid offers doctor consultations through a dedicated dashboard where verified doctors can connect with patients via video calls. With its multilingual, AI-powered interface and smart healthcare ecosystem, Med Aid bridges the gap between technology and accessibility—bringing reliable medical assistance to every corner of India.
